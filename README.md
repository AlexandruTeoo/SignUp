# SignUp
 I have developed an Android project using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose that simulates the user registration process within an application. The project includes three primary screens:

1. Home Screen: The entry point of the application, welcoming users and providing navigation to the registration process.
2. Data Entry Screen: This screen allows users to input their registration details, such as name, age, gender and email. The form includes validation to ensure the correctness and completeness of the data before proceeding.
3. Details Display Screen: Upon successful data entry and validation, this screen displays the entered user details, confirming the registration process.

The application leverages Jetpack Compose to create a modern, responsive, and declarative UI. This approach simplifies UI development, ensuring a seamless and efficient user experience throughout the registration process.
